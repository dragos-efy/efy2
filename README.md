# EFY UI (Temporary Clone, will be deleted soon)
Customisable, convergent, transparent, modular, futuristic css / js framework that can be added to your own web / local apps & websites

## How to use it
Add the `efy` folder in your project & the following html lines:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./efy/efy.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./demo/efy_config.css">

<!-- Your own css files here or inside efy_config.css -->

<script src="./efy/efy.js"></script>
```

`efy_config.css` is where the magic happens, there you can set your own defaults. More info on that will be added in the documentation soon. You can also add your own css inside after the template ends, or make a new file if you prefer to keep things separated. Both ways work, just make sure that `efy_config.css` runs **before** javascript so that it knows what your preferences are.

Live demo & Documentation at: https://efy.ooo/ui

Local demo: just download the files & open `efy_demo.html`.

## Can I use it commercially?

Yes, but please donate if you want to support the project and can afford it, that would help a lot! Read the license for more details.

## How to help or contact me

Feedback is very important, so the more the better! Take screenshots or record videos too of your issues / ideas if needed. You can do that here or in the matrix room: https://matrix.to/#/#efy_ui:matrix.org where you can also talk to the community.

## Future Plans

- make detailed & reliable documentation
- reduce the code by 1/3 (minus new features)
- improve accessibility
- collab with cool FOSS projects
- make html based apps that incorporate efy (todo list, dashboard, notes, text editor, music / video player etc)
- standardise transparent ui
- translate it into multiple languages statically (contact me if you know how)
